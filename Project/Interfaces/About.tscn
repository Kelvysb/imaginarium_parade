I had this idea while I was in a concert:  Ant√¥nio Vivaldi - Four Seasons
Before each part the maestro described the interpretations of the play
and I started imagining a live painting moving around with the notes,
like an moving exibition of Van Gogh that I visited a few months ago.

So the plataforms and the obstacles are positioned based on the music notes,
and all the art work is hand painted (digitally hand painted I mean).

Problably I'll continue this project adding the rest of the concert from A. Vivaldi, 
and making betters art work for all four season, maybe changing it to side scrolling for better gameplay.

Thanks for playing,
Kelvys B."
